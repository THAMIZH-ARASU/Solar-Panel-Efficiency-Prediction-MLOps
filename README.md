# ⚡ Solar Power System Analyzer

A robust, modular, and production-ready platform for solar power system data analysis, machine learning, and prediction. Built with **ZenML**, **Streamlit**, **MLflow**, and a rich Python data science stack, this project enables end-to-end workflows from data ingestion and EDA to model training, deployment, and inference—all with experiment tracking and a user-friendly web interface.

- **Inference Pipeline:** Dynamically loads models and produces predictions on new data, supporting batch inference.

### 2. **Modular ZenML Steps**
- **Data Ingestion:** Supports CSV and ZIP files, with extensible ingestion logic.
- **Missing Value Handling:** Multiple strategies (drop, mean, median, mode, constant, KNN, CatBoost, categorical fill).
- **Feature Engineering:** Categorical encoding, new feature creation (e.g., power, area).
- **Outlier Detection:** Z-score and IQR-based methods.
- **Model Building:** Supports Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost.
- **Model Evaluation:** Regression metrics with MLflow logging.
- **Model Saving/Loading:** Robust serialization and MLflow model registry integration.
- **Prediction & Saving:** Batch predictions and artifact logging.

### 3. **Interactive Streamlit Web App**
- **EDA Tab:** Upload CSVs and perform:
  - Missing value analysis (counts, heatmaps)
  - Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, correlation heatmaps, pairplots)
- **Prediction Tab:** Upload data, run the full inference pipeline, and download predictions.
- **Home & About Tabs:** Project overview and author information.
- **Production-Grade Logging:** All user actions, errors, and pipeline events are logged for traceability.

### 4. **Advanced EDA Utilities**
- Modular EDA code in `Analysis/AnalyzeSrc/` for:
  - Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
  - Missing value visualization
  - Encoding strategies and data inspection

### 5. **Experiment Tracking with MLflow**
- All model metrics, artifacts, and predictions are logged and tracked for reproducibility and comparison.

### 6. **Centralized Configuration**
- All pipeline and model parameters are managed via a single `config.py` dataclass for easy customization.

### 7. **Extensible and Production-Ready**
- Modular codebase with clear separation of concerns.
- Logging in every process (steps, pipelines, app).
- Ready for cloud or on-prem deployment.

## ⚡ Quickstart

### 1. **Install Requirements**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. **Train a Model**
```bash
python run_training.py
```
- Uses parameters from `config.py`.
- Trains and saves a model to `artifacts/model.joblib`.

### 3. **Run Inference**
```bash
python run_inference.py --data_path path/to/input.csv --feature_columns col1,col2,...
```
- Produces predictions in `artifacts/predictions.csv`.

### 4. **Run Deployment Pipeline**
```bash
python run_deployment.py
```
- Loads a trained model and generates predictions on test data.

### 5. **Launch the Streamlit App**
```bash
cd App
streamlit run app.py
```
- Explore EDA and make predictions via the web UI.

## 👀 Visualize and Manage Pipelines with ZenML Dashboard

ZenML provides a built-in dashboard to visualize, monitor, and manage your pipelines, steps, and artifacts.

To launch the ZenML dashboard, simply run:

```bash
zenml up
```

This will start the ZenML dashboard locally. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8237](http://localhost:8237) to:
- View all pipeline runs and their statuses
- Inspect step outputs, artifacts, and logs
- Monitor experiment lineage and metadata
- Manage stacks, orchestrators, and more

The dashboard is a powerful tool for tracking your ML workflow and debugging pipeline executions.

---

## 📝 Logging

- **App logs:** `App/app.log`
- **Pipeline logs:** `Pipelines/pipeline.log`
- **Step logs:** `Steps/step.log`
- All major actions, transitions, and errors are traceable for robust monitoring and debugging.
